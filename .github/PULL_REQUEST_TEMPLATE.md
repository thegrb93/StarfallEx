# Before creating pull request
- Move all changes to **separate** branch (Don't use master of your fork).
- **Don't** reuse branches.
- **Don't** sync that branch after creating pull request unless it's really needed. (IE. upstream changed code structure).
- Test it and try fixing bugs ahead.
- If you know about any bugs, make sure to list them in PR message.
- Make sure pull request message informs about **ALL** the changes.
- Your pull request can be work-in-progress if you want others to help you with coding or give you  opinions, just make sure to state it's not ready.
- Try to avoid messing with whitespaces. (Setup your editor properly to follow our style).
- If you find whitespaces that don't follow our style you can fix them in separate commit.
- Read about [github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
